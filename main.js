👉 Write your kata's scenario/description here!
Hello School of Code Warrior. 
It's time from being confused to confuse!
The Queen has invited you to a tea party, 
but for some reason the security guy has your name on black list.
To confuse his scanner shuffle your first and lastname in object person.
In person object there is a function called shuffle;
use this one to swap your first and last names to gain access to the tea party.
No need to alter anything else in the consfuseMe function.
Look forward to seeing you there!

//👉 Write the function your CodeWarriors will start with below here:
export function confuseMe(firstName, lastName) {


    let person = {
        name: firstName,
        surname: lastName, 


// work this shuffle function only  ☕🧁: 
        shuffle: () =>{

           
            
        }
// end of shuffle function  🧹🚁





    };
